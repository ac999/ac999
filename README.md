# Hi, I'm Andrei Cristian ðŸ‘‹

I'm a **Cybersecurity Engineer** currently focused on automotive security. My role centers on designing and implementing cybersecurity frameworks that align with ISO/SAE 21434 standards, using comprehensive TARA processes to drive secure system design.

### What I Do

- Develop cybersecurity requirements and contribute to system architecture design to safeguard automotive systems.
- Threat Analysis and Risk Assessment in Automotive Context.
- Create Security Concepts.

### My Projects

#### Format Preserving Encryption

- [Repository](https://github.com/ac999/go-fpe)
- Format-Preserving Encryption (FPE) implementation using FF1 algorithm in Go, following NIST SP 800-38G guidelines for cryptographic compliance.
  
#### Python Pseudorandom Generator - Bachelor's Thesis (in Romanian)

- [Repository](https://github.com/ac999/css)
- A pseudorandom generator based on the Modular Subset-Sum Problem.

#### Python Spam Filter

- [Repository](https://github.com/ac999/python-spam-filter)
- A spam filter using Bayse Naive and `sklearn`.
  
#### Web Server & Lua Load Balancer
- [Repository for C Web Server](https://github.com/ac999/Simple-Web-Server)
- [Repository for Rust Lua LB](https://github.com/ac999/lua-loadbalancer)
  Smaller projects that highlight my ability to work with low-level languages and scripting for automation.

#### Other Projects

- [Rezidentiat.com formatter](https://github.com/ac999/rezidentiat_com_formatter) - two Python scripts that automate processing HTML files saved from the rezidentiat.com website. These scripts help users extract and reformat data into more usable formats, such as .docx files for reports and .txt files for Quizlet flashcards.
- [Bash Script](https://github.com/ac999/git-repo-merge) to merge repositories from parent directory into current repository.
- [LFSR Implementation in VHDL](https://github.com/ac999/HAC).
- [Security Protocol Analysis](https://github.com/ac999/protocol_sec_msi) with AVISPA and Scyther.

### About Me
Iâ€™m passionate about building robust and secure systems that work in the real worldâ€”not theoretical constructs. I continuously explore how emerging technologies (like AI-driven automation) can enhance productivity and security in practical applications.

Feel free to check out my repositories and get in touch if youâ€™re interested in collaborating or discussing innovative ideas in cybersecurity and system automation.
